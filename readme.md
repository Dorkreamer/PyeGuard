# PyeGuard
A Safeguard for photosensitive people to enjoy the web.

# Usage
To use PyeGuard all you have to do is execute the launch.sh in your terminal.

# How does it work?
It constantly takes screenshots, resizes them to 16x16 and applies blur to analyze the percentage of how much colors have changed, if it surpasses the threshold without user interaction (Mouse/Keyboard clicks) it will keep calling `xset dpms force off` until the color changing is below the threshold again.

# Developing // Modifying

Simply open your IDE of choice, and a terminal, then source PyeGuard's virtual environment, located at `.venv` like this `souce .venv/bin/activate`. Once done so, you can just write your code away!
